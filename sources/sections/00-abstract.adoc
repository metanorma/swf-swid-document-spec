== Abstract

SWIDs are identifiers for the https://spatialwebfoundation.org/[Spatial Web],
with the following design goals and properties:

* All Spatial Web Entities (including Credentials) have SWIDs.
* The Spatial Web SWID Registry ensures uniqueness of the SWIDs.
* Most SWIDs will be created by a DID Issuer at behest of the Entity and not recorded in a centralized registry.
* The Spatial Web will include Entities with DIDs created without interaction with any particular authority.
