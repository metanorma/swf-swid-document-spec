SWIDs are identifiers for the Spatial Web (<<SWF>>), based on the with the
following design goals and properties:

* All Spatial Web Entities (including Credentials) have SWIDs.

* The Spatial Web SWID Registry ensures uniqueness of the SWIDs.

* Most SWIDs will be created by a DID Issuer at behest of the Entity and not
recorded in a centralized registry.

* The Spatial Web will include Entities with DIDs created without interaction
with any particular authority.
