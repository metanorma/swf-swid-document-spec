by the controller of the DID.

=== DID Controller

The entity that controls (create, updates, deletes) a given DID, as defined
in the <<DID-CORE,DID-CORE>>.

=== DID Document

A DID Document as defined by the <<DID-CORE,DID-CORE>> -- the document returned when a DID is resolved.

=== DID Method

DID methods are the mechanism by which a particular type of DID and its
associated DID document are created, resolved, updated, and deactivated. DID
methods are defined using separate DID method specifications.
